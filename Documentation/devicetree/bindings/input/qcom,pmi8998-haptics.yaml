description: |
  Qualcomm SPMI haptics is a peripheral on some QTI PMICs. It supports linear resonant
  actuators and eccentric rotating mass type haptics commonly found in mobile devices.
  It supports multiple sources of wave data such as an internal buffer, direct play
  (from kernel or userspace) as well as an audio output mode.
