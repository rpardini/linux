Amlogic SD / eMMC controller for S905/GXBB family SoCs

The MMC 5.1 compliant host controller on Amlogic provides the
interface for SD, eMMC and SDIO devices.

This file documents the properties in addition to those available in
the MMC core bindings, documented by mmc.txt.

Required properties:
- compatible : contains one of:
  - "amlogic,meson-gx-mmc"
  - "amlogic,meson-gxbb-mmc"
  - "amlogic,meson-gxl-mmc"
  - "amlogic,meson-gxm-mmc"
  - "amlogic,meson-axg-mmc"
- clocks     : A list of phandle + clock-specifier pairs for the clocks listed in clock-names.
- clock-names: Should contain the following:
	"core" - Main peripheral bus clock
	"clkin0" - Parent clock of internal mux
	"clkin1" - Other parent clock of internal mux
  The driver has an internal mux clock which switches between clkin0 and clkin1 depending on the
  clock rate requested by the MMC core.
- resets     : phandle of the internal reset line

Optional properties:
- amlogic,dram-access-quirk: set when controller's internal DMA engine cannot access the
  DRAM memory, like on the G12A dedicated SDIO controller.
- amlogic,mmc-phases: 3-element array of clock phases for core, tx, rx clock with values:
	0: CLK_PHASE_0 - 0 phase
	1: CLK_PHASE_90 - 90 phase
	2: CLK_PHASE_180 - 180 phase
	3: CLK_PHASE_270 - 270 phase
  By default driver use <CLK_PHASE_180 CLK_PHASE_0 CLK_PHASE_0> value.

Example:

	sd_emmc_a: mmc@70000 {
		compatible = "amlogic,meson-gxbb-mmc";
		reg = <0x0 0x70000 0x0 0x2000>;
		interrupts = < GIC_SPI 216 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
		clocks = <&clkc CLKID_SD_EMMC_A>, <&xtal>, <&clkc CLKID_FCLK_DIV2>;
		clock-names = "core", "clkin0", "clkin1";
		pinctrl-0 = <&emmc_pins>;
		resets = <&reset RESET_SD_EMMC_A>;
		amlogic,mmc-phases = <CLK_PHASE_180 CLK_PHASE_0 CLK_PHASE_0>;
	};
